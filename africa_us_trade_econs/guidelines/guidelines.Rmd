## **BACKGROUND**

The primary purpose of the African Centre for the Study of the United States (ACSUS) is to study the United States of America (US) and its relations with Africa. ACSUS covers Africa-US bilateral and multilateral relations, ranging from cultural and educational exchanges to political and diplomatic missions. Among the most important relationships are economics and trade. Past initiatives like the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), Prosper Africa, and PEPFAR gave Africa access to the US market. The Biden administration has returned Americaâ€™s to multilateralism. This shift coincides with the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area. ACSUS Africa-US economic and trade project will pinpoint the direction US-Africa relations. The project seeks to uncover, among other issues, what has worked well in the Africa-US economics and trade sphere, opportunities and bottlenecks in Africa-US trade,  and how to deepen these relations.
